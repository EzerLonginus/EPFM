# PREAMP
This is the first project out of the Electronic Projects for Musicians

## Adjustments and Modifications
<ol>
<li>Swapped the 4739 quad operational amplifier for a more available chip (TL074)</li>
<li>Power Input is based on the Eurorack Standard.  +/-12V, +5V IDC connection</li>
<li>Added a jumper for the VU meter input to either directly connect the balanced output to the meter, or to monitor something else</li>
<li>In order to get a VU meter to function for me, I added some additional diodes and capacitors on the output of U1B</li>
<li>The 1M potentiometer on the output of U1B allows for tuning of the signal to calibrate the VU Meter<li>
</ol>
