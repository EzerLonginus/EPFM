Building out the projects from Craig Anderton's Book Electronic Projects for Musicians.

This book was a primary inspiration for me when I was growing up, and I've always wanted to actually complete a good amount of these projects.  The parts listed in the projects were always obsolete or difficult to source.  Having a little more experience than when I was a kid, I took to time to revisit some of these projects.  Not sure I'll post all the projects, since some aren't really projects ("PROJECT 19: Using a Volt Ohm-Millameter"), but maybe I'll try post something in the spirit of those projects. 

## OBJECTIVES
<ol>
<li>Modify existing schematics with parts that are currently in stock and with similar electrical properties</li>
<li>Try to design the PCBs for through hole components to make it easier for more people to create the boards</li>
<li>Design the PCBs to be friendly with desktop PCB milling machines should one choose to go that route.</li>
    <li>I tried to keep most of the traces on the bottom side of the board</li>
    <li>Where top side traces where necessary I kept those straight with large vias so people could just use a jumper wire</li>
<li>Design the boards and face plate to fit within the Eurorack standard</li>
<li>Document additional modifications and findings</li>
</ol>
